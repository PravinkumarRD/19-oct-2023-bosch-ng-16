PoC - Proof-Of-Concept [Fullstack - MEAN/Angular + Microsoft/Angular + Java/...] [SQL/NoSQL]
		[M - MongoDB/ E - ExpressJS / A -  Angular, Node JS]
		SPA - Single Page Application
		Security [Authentication/Authorization/Security Trimming]

Why Angular?

1) Angular is a one framework for [Web App/Desktop/Mobile Web/Native Mobile Apps]
2) Angular framework talks about speed and performance
3) Angular framework is a modular framework
4) Develop your own application in modular way
5) Angular enables modules to be loaded in eager and lazy way
6) Angular framework offers multiple development languages
	[Typescript/ES5/ESNext/Dart]
7) Two compilation models
	[JIT - Just-In-Time/ AoT - Ahead-Of-Time- Production] [Starting with Ng 9 - Default is AoT]
8) Develop SPA - Single Page Application
9) Routing - @angular/router
10) From Angular 2-8 [ViewEngine] and from Angular 9-16 [Ivy Endering]
11) Angular offers component based development
		[Create custom/reusable tag - Display/Extends the vocabulary of HTML - <bosch-3d-chart/>]
12) Rich Data Binding support [Source-To-Destination/Destination-To-source/Two-Way]
13) Zone.JS
14) CDC - Change Detection Cycle
15) Rich Data Formatting - Pipes [In-built/Third-party pipes/Custom Pipes]
16) Rich Directives [In-built/Third-Party/Custom]
	Directive extends the behaviour of an Html Element of component
17) Services in Angular [Share data and logic in Angular application]
18) In-built support for IoC and D.I.
19) Http support [Perform CRUD operations using Http Service with Http verbs - GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]
20) Angular support rich animations - @angular/animations
21) Angular Library Development - Enable developers to reuse the components in different Angular projects
22) Angular offers Angular Component Library along with CDK - Component Development Kit
	@angular/material
23) Use Angular components in Non-Angular application - Angular Elements [For Ex - React/Vue JS/Html&JS/...]
24) Angular Forms - 
	1) Template Driven Forms
	2) Reactive Forms
25) Angular has integration with a third party library RxJS - Reactive Extensions for JavaScript Library
	Observable-Observer pattern
26) Angular offers CLI [Command Line Interface] tool to create Angular applications/libraries
	@angular/cli
27) Angular out-of-the-box uses Jasmine framework for writing test cases
28) Angular uses Karma Test Runner tool to run Jasmine Test cases
29) Support for PWA - Progressive Web Application 
30) SSR - Server Side Rendering - @angular/universal
		SEOs cannot crawl them


Angular Framework's major building blocks - 

	1) NgModule
	2) Component
	3) Directive
	4) Pipe
	5) Service

Angular Application Bootstraping process
	1) By default, when you create your first angular application, you will always one module and one component
	2) Modules are like blackbox. Nothing goes out or nothing come in unless and until you want it


Create first Angular application - 

	1) Install Angular CLI Globally on your machine
		npm install @angular/cli --global 
	2) How do you check CLI version?
		ng v
	3) Create new Angular Project/Application
		ng new first-ng-app

Angular Coding Style Guide
	https://angular.io/guide/styleguide


In Angular framework, all major building blocks are classes

Angular framework offers Number of Metadatas - Metadata tells Angular framework how to process a perticular class, Property, Data  Members, function, ...

	All the metadatas come from @angular/core library
	
1)NgModule Metadata - 
	@NgModule({
  	    imports:[Day2Module], //All the dependency modules
	    exports:[], //Anything you want to use outside this module
	    declarations:[], //Entries of Components, Directives and Pipes
	    providers:[], //Entries of Service(s)
	    bootstrap:[] //component(s) entries which you want to render when the first page is renderd on your browser
	})
	class Day1Module{

	}

	@NgModule({
  	    imports:[], //All the dependency modules
	    exports:[Day2Component1], //Anything you want to use outside this module
	    declarations:[Day2Component1], //Entries of Components, Directives and Pipes
	    providers:[], //Entrries of Service(s)
	})
	class Day2Module{

	}

1) Component Metadata - 
	@Component({
	    selector:'', //CSS Selector. It is an name of your element which you use in Html. For Example - <bosch-root></bosch-root>
	    template:''//Display
	})

Angular CLI tool offers generate commands using which we can add - 
	ng-modules, components, services, pipes, directive, interface, classes, ..

	Generate commands - 

		1) Add NgModule with feature-folder - 
			ng g m employees
		2) Add component
			ng g c employees/components/employees-list
		3) Add pipe
			ng g p employees/pipes/name-of-the-pipe
		4) Add directive
			ng g d employees/directives/name-of-the-directive
		5) Add service
			ng g s employees/services/name-of-the-service
		other commands
			ng g class employees/models/employee
			ng g class/interface/... into respective folders

Introduction to Component - 
	1) Component is a part of webpage
	2) Component extends the vocabulary of Html - Tags
	3) Component is used for display
	4) Component is a special type of directive
	5) Component development contains 3 parts - 
		
Component is divided into three parts - [HTML, CSS, Component class - logic]
	1) Component Logic - written in component class
	2) Component Template - [Display] - template:''/""/``
		i) Inline Template [2-3 lines of code]
			a) Single or double quotes
			b) Backtick syntax
		ii) Linked/External Template [.html file] - templateUrl:'file-path'

Data Binding - 
	One-Way - Source -To- Destination
		i) Interpolation
		2) Property Binding - DOM Properties


In-build Directives
	Looping Directive
		*ngFor = For-Of
	Conditional Directive
		*ngIf;else
In-built element from Angular framework
	<ng-template></ng-template>



Second Feature - events - 

	ng g m events

	ng g c events/components/events-list
	ng g c events/components/event-details

	ng g class events/models/event

Data Formatting in Angular - 

	Use pipe in Component template and the syntax is - 

		property|pipe-name
		property|pipe-name:'agr1':'arg2':'arg3'
		property|pipe-name:'agr1':'arg2':'arg3'|pipe-name:'arg1'|pipe-name
	Pipes -
		1) In-built Pipes
			lowercase, uppercase, titlecase, currency, date, ...
		2) Custom Pipes - camel case the pipe name
			1) Write a pipe which will display the date in a choice of language
				Ex - startDate|dateInternationalization:'es-ES'
			2) Write a pipe which will filter the events by event name
				Use Two-Way data binding
				[(ngModel)]
				ngModel - directive comes from a separate library - @angular/forms
					FormsModule which exports ngModel directive			
		3) Third-party Pipes
			ngx-pagination - Package [npm i ngx-pagination]
				NgxPaginationModule
					1) Pipe - paginate
					2) Component - Pagination Control

How does pipe work internally?

import { Pipe, TransformPipe } from '@angular/core'

@Pipe({
	name:'awesome'
})
class MyAwesomePipe implements TransformPipe {
	transform(value:unknown, ...args:unknown[]):unknown{
		//Check the arguments and write the logic based on arguments
		//you write the logic to transform/format the value
		//return formatted value
	}
}

property|awesome
property|awesome:'one':'two'



Assignments - 
	1) Add pipe which will filters employees to display all employees list which contains the starts with
	2) Add pipe which will display employees who had joined the company on a given date
	3) Sort employees by the listed columns in EmployeesListComponent
		Default - Ascending and Descending [Pipes/your logic]
	4) Complete the display of EmployeeDetailsComponent
	5) Dsiplay Joining date of an Employee in your local language using dateInternationalization
	6) Apply pagination on employees table
